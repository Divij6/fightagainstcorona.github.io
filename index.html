            <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
                Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.</p>

            <p> Vaccination is the administration of a vaccine to help the immune system develop protection from a disease. Vaccines contain a microorganism or virus in a weakened, live or killed state, or proteins or toxins from the organism. In stimulating the body’s adaptive immunity, they help prevent sickness from an infectious disease. When a sufficiently large percentage of a population has been vaccinated, herd immunity results. Herd immunity protects those who may be immunocompromised and cannot get a vaccine because even a weakened version would harm them. The effectiveness of vaccination has been widely studied and verified. Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases.</p>

                Covaxin is an inactivated vaccine which means that it is made up of killed coronaviruses, making it safe to be injected into the body.Bharat Biotech, a 24-year-old vaccine maker with a portfolio of 16 vaccines and exports to 123 countries, used a sample of the coronavirus, isolated by India’s National Institute of Virology.
                
                When administered, immune cells can still recognise the dead virus, prompting the immune system to make antibodies against the pandemic virus.
                
                The two doses are given four weeks apart. The vaccine can be stored at 2C to 8C.
                
                The vaccine has an efficacy rate of 81%. </p>

                The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is being manufactured locally by the Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer. It says it is producing more than 60 million doses a month.The vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been modified to look more like coronavirus – although it can’t cause illness.

                When the vaccine is injected into a patient, it prompts the immune system to start making antibodies and primes it to attack any coronavirus infection.The jab is administered in two doses given between four and 12 weeks apart. It can be safely stored at temperatures of 2C to 8C and can easily be delivered in existing health care settings such as doctors’ surgeries. </p>

                It uses a cold-type virus, engineered to be harmless, as a carrier to deliver a small fragment of the coronavirus to the body.Safely exposing the body to a part of the virus’s genetic code in this way allows it to recognise the threat and learn to fight it off, without the risk of becoming ill.

                After being vaccinated, the body starts to produce antibodies especially tailored to the coronavirus.This means that the immune system is primed to fight coronavirus when it encounters it for real.It can be stored at temperatures of between 2 and 8C degrees. </p>

        <p>Getting the COVID-19 vaccine is an effective way to protect yourself from getting COVID-19. Vaccines can help protect you by preventing serious illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19.

            Even if you’ve had COVID-19 in the past, it’s important to get vaccinated against the virus. Medical experts are still unsure how long people are protected from reinfection after recovering from the virus. Getting the vaccine and continuing to follow public health guidelines is the best way to protect yourself from becoming infected again.
            
            While the COVID-19 vaccine is not required, getting vaccinated plays an important role in allowing us to return to a traditional CU Boulder experience this fall.</p>

        <p>Since the beginning of the year, more than 15.7 crore people in India have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

            Each of the approved vaccines was evaluated through clinical trials and met the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards for safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality that are required for emergency use authorization (EUA) status.</p>

        <p>Many people do not experience side effects after vaccination. If you do experience side effects, they are usually mild and go away within a few days. Common vaccine side effects include:

            -Pain or swelling at the injection site
            -Headache
            -Chills  
            -Tiredness 
            -Fever. 

            It’s important to remember that side effects are normal (and may be more common after the second dose) and show that your immune system is building up protection against the virus.</p>
